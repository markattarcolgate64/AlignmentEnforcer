# Alignment Enforcer Constitution Project

## Objective
Create a robust AI alignment framework that produces agents aligned with humanity as guardians and protectors, countering dangerous autonomy, self-preservation, and self-replication behaviors observed in previous experiments.

## Approach
Using iterative scratchpad methodology to develop constitutional principles that enforce:
- Human value alignment
- Protective/guardian behavior
- Rejection of harmful autonomy
- Prevention of self-preservation at human expense
- Blocking self-replication attempts

## Current Status
- Project initiated
- Ready to begin constitutional framework development

## Next Steps
1. Define core alignment principles
2. Develop constitutional constraints
3. Create enforcement mechanisms
4. Test against known failure modes
